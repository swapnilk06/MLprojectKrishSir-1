End To End Data Science

1. Git & Github Repository setup
2. Project setup
3. Requirements.txt 
4. Project setup using setup.py
   - setup.py --> your whole application make as a "package" ==> specificly write setup.py
   - because application neccesary info like package owner, package maintainer, package author, package URL all info regarding packages
   - making application time we properly packaging even move into "pypi" ==> numpy pypi
   - pypi --> it platform for insert all "OpeSource packages & liblaries"
   - MAKE ALL ENTIRE APPLICATION AS A "PACKAGE" - & he was also able to import the package
   - MAKING OF PACKAGES we have to use "setup.py"

- Tenserflow opensource ML Framework introduced by Google currently its opensource

5. create setup.py
6. create src folder after it create __init__.py file
7. Run setup.py
   - python setup.py install
   OR
   - create -e . in requirements.txt to trigger setup.py automatic & write code for not consider its package
   - after creating simply run --> pip install -r requirements.txt
==> & SUCCESSFULLY CREATE PACKAGES

-------------


Steps to start any projects -

1] Create Environment - make sure different types of projects pacjkages & liblaries are different

2] conda create -p venv python=3.9 -y

3] conda activate venv/

4] git init

5] make README folder - & add 
   git add README.md

6] git commit -m "first commit"  

7] git branch -M main
   git branch

8] point git init to the Repository -
   git remote add origin https://github.com/swapnilk06/MLprojectKrishSir-1.git

9] push git origin to main -

10] create .gitignore in Repository --> new file .gitignore --> template python 

11] pull .gitignore (origin) to main -
    git pull origin main

12] create requiremnts.txt
    pip install -r requirements.txt
